  ## Description
  This is a Google Books search engine. Users are able to search for books by: title, author name, image, link, or description. If a user wishes to save a book, they will need to create an account. If a user has no network connection, the application uses local storage, they will be able to view books they previously saved. This application is a refactored version of a RESTful API application. It now runs off of a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server and was deployed using Heroku.
